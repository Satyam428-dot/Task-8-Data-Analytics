# Task-8-Data-Analytics
### Data Preparation:
Load necessary tables (Orders, Returns) into Power BI. Rename columns and eliminate irrelevant ones for a cleaner dataset.

### Data Transformation:
Use Power Query to filter columns and ensure correct data types. Create a custom date table for better time-based calculations and improved report performance.

### Data Modeling:
Establish relationships between tables. Organize calculated measures in a dedicated "Key Measures" table. Create measures such as Sales, Profit, Percentage of Returned Orders, and their year-over-year metrics.

### Visualization Techniques:
Use clean designs and conditional formatting to enhance chart readability. Implement storytelling techniques like slicer panels for interactive filtering.

### Answering Analytical Questions:
Metrics like sales, profit, percentage changes year-over-year are showcased using KPIs and charts. Visualizations identify trends, profitability by product, profit distribution across regions, and sales segmentation.

### Bookmarks and Slicer Panels:
Design slicer panels to filter data dynamically, improving user experience.
